```{r}
x <- 1:25
plot(x)
```

```{r}
xx <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
yy <- c(1, 4, 9, 16, 25)
X <- data.frame(xx, yy)
X
pairs(X)
```


coplot uses this formula: coplot(a ~ b | c + d),
This outputs scatter plots of a versus b for every joint conditioning interval of c and d.
```{r}
#a simple coplot
coplot(lat ~ long | depth, data = quakes)
```

Example of persp(x, y, z...)
```{r}
require(grDevices) #for trans3d
```
```{r}
x <- seq(-10, 10, length = 30)
y <- x
f <- function(x, y) {r <- sqrt(x^2 + y^2); 10 * sin(r)/r}
z <- outer(x, y, f)
z[is.na(z)] <- 1
op <- par(bg = "white")
persp(x, y, z, theta = 30, phi = 30, expand = 0.5, col = "lightblue")
```
```{r}
persp(x, y, z, theta = 30, phi = 30, expand = 0.5, col = "pink",
      ltheta = 120, shade = 0.75, ticktype = "detailed",
      xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", zlab = "Sinc(r)")

# Argugments of high-level plotting function - see page 161 in book. (or just documentation for this)
- it is possible to add legend boxs

#There are also graphic parameters that can be manipulated

#See page 168 on how to do Multiple figure outputs
-"In R, one may create an n Ã— m  array of figures in a page, with each figure having its own margins and with the array of figures optionally surrounded by an outer margin or border. In the documentation of par{graphics}..."
